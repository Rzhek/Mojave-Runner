The projects represents a infinite-level game where the player controls the turtle and has a goal to run as far as possible overcoming the obstacles (cactuses and wolves). Initially the player has 3 hearts and loses each heart if they touch an obstacle . The player's score is displayed throught the game and is calculated based on the time player was running

The project has a potential to scale by adding more types obstacles, textures of turtles and obstacles, and parallax layers
